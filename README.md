# Welcome to the Lab practices for PG4200 Algorithms & Data Structures Spring 26


## Info

> To work on the assignments, you should place all your code in the `src/main/java/assignment` folder. To test your code, you will find the test setup
in the `src/test/java/assignment/TestAssignment.java` folder. There you can choose to run all tests at once or run them one by one.
>
> Remember to commit your code frequently and push it to GitHub when you are stuck and want feedback from
> your group or student assistants.
>
> When you feel that you have finished the assignments, even if you are not able to solve everything,
> please push to GitHub. It would give us teachers a better overview of the class
> progress.
>
> Good luck!
